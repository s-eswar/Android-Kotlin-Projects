# Imagin8ors Android Kotlin Projects
Attempts to recreate the Imagin8ors LearningPod App in Android Studio using Kotlin Language.
This repository contains 7 android projects for the same App. This is because of the stepwise 
improvements to achieving the partial look of the complicated app. However, they are not placed in order. 
**One Exception**: 
              This repo also includes a library books display app for my [Library books API](https://github.com/s-eswar/advanced-jaxrs).
